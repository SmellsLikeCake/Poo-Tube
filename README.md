# Poo-Tube
This project investigates which London Underground tube lines are most soiled.

The analysis is done in python and can be found in the [Poo-Tube-Investigation.ipynb] (https://github.com/SmellsLikeCake/Poo-Tube/blob/master/Poo-Tube-Investigation.ipynb) notebook.

The write-up for this project can be found on my blog [https://showmeinpictures.com/poo-tube/] (https://showmeinpictures.com/poo-tube/).
